I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/) in Montreal. Before Deepmind, I was a Member of Technical Staff at [OpenAI](https://openai.com).

I am interested in using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) to train highly general agents. In particular, my work have focused on using curricula with meta-RL techniques to train agents with emergent capabilities such as sim-to-real transfer [P1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07113), social learning [P2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00715), and human time-scale adaptation [P3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07608).

Please reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or chat.
